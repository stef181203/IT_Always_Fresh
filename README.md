# Always Fresh
This project is created in .NET MVC and is my first ever web application project.

It has very basic functionalities like:
- Browsing for products (search bar, category selection, sorting order, pagination);
- Adding/Removing products to/from the shopping cart;
- Basic user authentication (register and login) that enables the user to add products to cart
  and to be able to "buy" them;

Apart from the user visible functionalities, it is important to know that in this project I used
the Model-View-Controller pattern and SQL Server Express LocalDB for the back-end, with a combination 
of JavaScript on the front-end used for processing the responses for the few REST API calls.
